A Minecraft Online Server project
MMORPG-Parkour gaming as highlight for this server. You can find cities, terrains, race nations, skyscrapers, geographical icons, railways, red stone elevators and machines. Half-open world PVP experience. Started in 2010 and was indefinitely paused since 2013. Minecraft version 1.3.1 is needed getting in.
